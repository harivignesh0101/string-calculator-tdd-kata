# String Calculator TDD Kata

This repository is an exploration of the **String Calculator** Kata using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The String Calculator is a simple exercise that focuses on incremental development with tests driving the code design and implementation.

## Objective
The goal is to implement a `StringCalculator` class that performs string-based arithmetic operations, adhering to TDD principles. Tests will be written incrementally, starting from the simplest case and progressing to more complex scenarios.

## Requirements
1. Create a method `add(String numbers)` that takes a string of numbers separated by commas and returns their sum.
2. Follow TDD principles: write a test, make it pass, refactor, and repeat.


## TDD Workflow
1. Write a failing test for the simplest possible functionality.
2. Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code for clarity, simplicity, and performance.
4. Repeat until all features are implemented.
